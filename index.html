      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>I am an M.S. Research Scholar at the prestigious IIT Madras in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Machine Design. My research focuses on the development of phased array ultrasonic imaging algorithms for defect detection, equipping me with expertise in finite element simulation, signal processing, imaging systems, defect detection, and characterization. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, data analysis, Python, and MATLAB, enabling me to effectively address complex engineering challenges.

Research Interest:

I am deeply passionate about leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies to drive innovation in imaging systems, automatic defect recognition, predictive maintenance, and smart manufacturing. By integrating data science, AI/ML, and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques, I aim to contribute to the development of intelligent systems that enhance industrial efficiency, safety, and quality.</p>
